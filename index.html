     <h1>Hi, I'm Maggie Yang!</h1>
     <h2>Welcome To My Personal Webpage</h2>
     <h3>Profile/About Me</h3>
     <p>My birth name is Chu Yue Yang but I prefer to go by Maggie. I'm looking to start a new journey in software development.</p>
     <p><!--This is where I'll put a Famous Quote --></p>
     <h4>Interests/Hobbies</h4>
     <p>I've done gymnastics for over 10 years and I've been doing it competitively for over 9 years. I can do splits and flips, however I might be out of practice now. The committment to gymnastics I had allowed me to develop a regular exercise routine that I still follow today. This habit has been really helping me get the required exercise I need during the pandemic.</p>
     <p>I've been taking Chinese Folk Dancing Classes for over 11 years now. I've performed in places from parks and malls to large theater stages. It's been a great way for me to connect with people and with my own culture. I hope to continue dancing and performing once the pandemic is over.</p>
     <p>During my free time, I like to enjoy myself while reading a good book. I'm very much invested in multiple teenage fantasy and sci-fi fiction novels like the Illuminae series and the Throne of Glass series. If I'm not relaxing while I'm reading, then I'm either making some sort or arts and crafts project or watching some anime.</p>

     <h3>My Journey</h3>
     <h4>Education</h4>
     <h5>Victoria Park Collegiate Institue</h5>
     <p>I went to Victoria Park C.I. for high school where I was in the International Baccalaureate (or IB for short) Program. It's also where I received my IB Diploma. Most notably, I took IB French, Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science courses. In Computer Science specifically, I was taught about Object Oriented Programming using Java, HTML, CSS, Abstract Programming Structures and Hardware Components. During my time in high school, I was an executive leader for the FRC Robotics Team 4914 Panthers where I learned about managing a time and the nitty gritty details of programming a functional robot.</p>
     <h5>University of Waterloo</h5>
     <p>I entered the University of Waterloo's Software Engineering program in the fall of 2020 and I am currently in the winter study term 1B of the program. The most notable course I have taken so far is CS137 where I have learned about memory allocation, programming dynamic data structures and coding in C programming language.</p>
